## Project Scope

This was a personal project in which the goal was to create a simple personal website that i could use as a "portfolio" of sorts, and easily update and mantain during its lifespan.

which to date should be the website where this is currently being viewed.


## Technology Stack

The website is developed using Gatsby.

Gatsby was chosen as the framework because it matched on the goals i had for the website when it was first developed.

Gatsby facilitates the generation of static-websites and makes it easy to dynamicly add new pages/segments from markup files.

## Roles

First and foremost, need to give credit where credit is due.

The design you see is from <a href="https://html5up.net/m"><b>HTML5 UP</b></a> who does a great job creating responsive designs you can use.

And <a href="https://github.com/anubhavsrivastava"><b>Anubhav Srivastava</b></a> for converting the desing into a <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/anubhavsrivastava/gatsby-starter-solidstate"><b>Gatsby JS starter</b></a>.

Using this design and starter, what was left to do was setting up Gatsby to read from markup files and create pages from them dynamicly.
